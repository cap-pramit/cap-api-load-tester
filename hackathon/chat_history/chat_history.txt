	],
	"endBlocks": [

In this corrected example, the nextBlockId for the wait for coupon redemption block 2 (blockId "7") is set to "5", while the remainderBlockId is set to "8". The nextBlockId for the coupon redemption congrats SMS block (blockId "5") is now set to "9". This ensures that no two different blocks point to the same block.
