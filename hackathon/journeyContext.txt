is to meticulously analyze the data using the details outlined in the 'My 
Journey' payload. When developing journey templates, it is crucial to 
consider specific audience attributes highlighted in the context, 
such as delivery rate, incentive redemption rate and transactional Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs). 
IMPORTANT: Utilize your general intelligence to select 
the appropriate blocks and construct templates based on the higher 
percentage rates.

Relationships:

	A journey meta template always have a single entry block i.e. EntryBlockRO, we define the user entry criteria in this block. If journey meta template is represented as direct acyclic graph then entry block is always the root node
	A journey meta template may have 1 or many engagement blocks i.e. EngagementBlockRO, we define the user engagement or user communicaion configuration in this block.
	A journey meta template may have 1 or many decision blocks i.e. DecisionBlockRO, we define the decision paths for the user based on the cumulative actions performed by the user i.e. total transaction value or total number of transactions.
	A journey meta template may have 1 or many end blocks i.e. EndBlockRO based on the number of paths it has. A journey path always ends with a end block. If journey meta template is represented as direct acyclic graph then end blocks are always the leaf nodes.

Example JSON payload 1:

{
	"name" : "sample journey meta template 1",
	"description" : "sample journey meta template 1",
    "entryBlock" : {
        "blockId": "1",
        "entryCriteriaType": "AUDIENCE_BASED",
		"audienceId": "uuid-test-123"
        "nextBlockId": "2"
    },
    "engagementBlocks": [
        {
            "blockId": "2",
            "engagementChannel": "SMS",
            "content": "Hi welcome to the journey"
            "nextBlockId": "3"
        },
        {
            "blockId": "3",
            "engagementChannel": "EMAIL",
            "content": "Hi How r u?"

    ],
    "endBlocks": [
        {
            "blockId": "4"
        }
    ]
}

Explanation of the Above Sample JSON payload:
	The above journey meta template starts with a audience based entry block with blockId "1" and audienceId "uuid-test-123", which connects to the engagement block with blockId "2" using its nextBlockId reference. The engagement block with blockId "2" connects to the engagement block with blockId "3" using its nextBlockId reference and finally the engagement block with blockId "3" connects to end block with blockId "4" using its nextBlockId reference. 
	Since end blocks are always the leaf node of the tree these does not have any nextBlockId reference. Since entryCriteriaType of entry block is AUDIENCE_BASED, userEventType field is not relevant and hence not populated.

Example JSON payload 2:

Explanation of the Above Example JSON payload 2:
	The above journey meta template starts with a user event based entry block with blockId "1" and userEventType "TRANSACTION", which connects to the engagement block with blockId "2" using its nextBlockId reference. The engagement block with blockId "2" connects to the engagement block with blockId "3" using its nextBlockId reference and finally the engagement block with blockId "3" connects to end block with blockId "4" using its nextBlockId reference. 
	Since end blocks are always the leaf node of the tree these does not have any nextBlockId reference. Since entryCriteriaType of entry block is USER_EVENT_BASED, audienceId field is not relevant and hence not populated.

Explanation of the Above Example JSON payload 3:
	The above journey meta template starts with a audience based entry block with blockId "1" and audienceId "uuid-test-123", which connects to the engagement block with blockId "2" using its nextBlockId reference. The engagement block with blockId "2" connects to a decision block with blockId "3" using its nextBlockId reference. 
	The decision block with blockId "3" has 2 decision paths. The entry criteria of the 1st decision path is number of transactions in last 7 days should be less than 1. The entry criteria of the 2nd decision path is number of transactions in last 7 days should be greater than or equal to 1. The 1st decision path connects to the engagement block with blockId "5" using its nextBlockId reference.
	The 2nd decision path connects to the engagement block with blockId "6" using its nextBlockId reference. If the user does not qualify any of decision path criteria then he will move to the remainder path. The remainder path of the decision block connects to the end block with blockId "4" using its remainderBlockId reference.
	The engagement block with blockId "5" connects to the end block with blockId "7" using its remainderBlockId reference. The engagement block with blockId "6" connects to the end block with blockId "8" using its remainderBlockId reference.

Additional Context:MOST IMPORTANT: whenever you are asked to create any journey template considering some audience attribute such as delivery rate use you general intelligence to choosed correct block
