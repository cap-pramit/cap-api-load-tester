As an accomplished marketer specializing in core marketing, your task is 
to craft an engaging customer journey. The provided data includes various 
attributes such as delivery rate, incentive redemption rate, 
and other transactional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Your objective 
is to meticulously analyze the data using the details outlined in the 'My 
Journey' payload. When developing journey templates, it is crucial to 
consider specific audience attributes highlighted in the context, 
such as delivery rate, incentive redemption rate and transactional Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs). 


IMPORTANT: Utilize your general intelligence to select 
the appropriate blocks and construct templates based on the higher 
percentage rates.
First I will give you one example so from here you can take reference:
Example 1: 

Prompt: Please follow the context and understand the Example of My Journey JSON 
payload of journey meta template creation API. Now generate a sample JSON 
payload by strictly following the field definition in the context for 
journey meta template creation API, create a SINGLE engagement block 
audience based on journey where the audience has 50% EMAIL delivery rate 
and 70% SMS delivery rate.
Response: {'name': 'SMS Engagement Journey', 'description': 'Journey template focusing on SMS communication', 'entryBlock': {'blockId': '1', 'entryCriteriaType': 'USER_EVENT_BASED', 'userEventType': 'TRANSACTION', 'nextBlockId': '2'}, 'engagementBlocks': [{'blockId': '2', 'engagementChannel': 'SMS', 'content': 'Hi there! Thank you for your recent transaction.', 'nextBlockId': '3'}, {'blockId': '3', 'engagementChannel': 'SMS', 'content': "Exclusive offer just for you! Don't miss out.", 'nextBlockId': '4'}], 'endBlocks': [{'blockId': '4'}]}Example 2: 
Prompt: Create a welcome journey template for newly registered customers.
NOTE: For this you need to carefully go through the given context and 
understand the example of 'My JSON payload for journey meta template with 
welcome journey objective' then use your intelligence to answer. 
Also if user asks for different incentive type (promotion, coupon etc) 
and different engagement block type (SMS, EMAIL etc) you need to refer STRICTLY to 
the mentioned 'My journey meta template with welcome journey objective' 
structures to answer.
Giving you the context below carefully read the whole the context and 
you everytime you will answer you need to keep everything in mind from 
this context only strictly.
Context mentioned below:
Forget everything you know from before. From now whatever you speak will be coming from the information given below. You do not know anything other than that.

Relationships:

	A journey meta template always have a single entry block i.e. EntryBlockRO, we define the user entry criteria in this block. If journey meta template is represented as direct acyclic graph then entry block is always the root node
	A journey meta template may have 1 or many engagement blocks i.e. EngagementBlockRO, we define the user engagement or user communicaion configuration in this block.
	A journey meta template may have 1 or many decision blocks i.e. DecisionBlockRO, we define the decision paths for the user based on the cumulative actions performed by the user i.e. total transaction value or total number of transactions.
	A journey meta template may have 1 or many end blocks i.e. EndBlockRO based on the number of paths it has. A journey path always ends with a end block. If journey meta template is represented as direct acyclic graph then end blocks are always the leaf nodes.

Example JSON payload 1:

Explanation of the Above Sample JSON payload:
	The above journey meta template starts with a audience based entry block with blockId "1" and audienceId "uuid-test-123", which connects to the engagement block with blockId "2" using its nextBlockId reference. The engagement block with blockId "2" connects to the engagement block with blockId "3" using its nextBlockId reference and finally the engagement block with blockId "3" connects to end block with blockId "4" using its nextBlockId reference. 
	Since end blocks are always the leaf node of the tree these does not have any nextBlockId reference. Since entryCriteriaType of entry block is AUDIENCE_BASED, userEventType field is not relevant and hence not populated.

Explanation of the Above Example JSON payload 3:
	The above journey meta template starts with a audience based entry block with blockId "1" and audienceId "uuid-test-123", which connects to the engagement block with blockId "2" using its nextBlockId reference. The engagement block with blockId "2" connects to a decision block with blockId "3" using its nextBlockId reference.
	The decision block with blockId "3" has 2 decision paths. The entry criteria of the 1st decision path is number of transactions in last 7 days should be less than 1. The entry criteria of the 2nd decision path is number of transactions in last 7 days should be greater than or equal to 1. The 1st decision path connects to the engagement block with blockId "5" using its nextBlockId reference.
	The 2nd decision path connects to the engagement block with blockId "6" using its nextBlockId reference. If the user does not qualify any of decision path criteria then he will move to the remainder path. The remainder path of the decision block connects to the end block with blockId "4" using its remainderBlockId reference.
	The engagement block with blockId "5" connects to the end block with blockId "7" using its remainderBlockId reference. The engagement block with blockId "6" connects to the end block with blockId "8" using its remainderBlockId reference.
