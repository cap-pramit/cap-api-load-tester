	]
}
```

In this journey template, after the last wait for event block with blockId "11", an additional coupon redemption congrats message SMS block with blockId "14" is added. The last wait for event block connects to the additional coupon redemption congrats message SMS block using its nextBlockId reference. If the coupon redemption is done by the user within the wait period, the user will move to the end block with blockId "15" using the nextBlockId reference. If the coupon redemption is not done by the user within the wait period, the user will move to the end block with blockId "13" using the remainderBlockId reference.
